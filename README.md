# Ovaltine

The chocolatey treat which makes your code clean! Yum!

`Ovaltine` scans your `storyboard` files and generates constant files for view controller, segue, and reuse identifiers. For instance, if you have a storyboard called `Main` and a view controller with the Storyboard ID `authenticationViewController`, then you can instantiate that controller with something like `[ABCMainStoryboard instantiateAuthenticationViewController]`. No mistyping, plenty of chocolately goodness.

# Installation

```
gem install ovaltine
```

Run `ovaltine` from the command line
